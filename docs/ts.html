<h1 class="title toc-ignore">What is Tourette’s Syndrome?</h1>

</div>


<p>I have a neurological movement disorder called Tourette’s Syndrome.
It is a difficult and complex disorder. People are born with this
disorder and it is lifelong. The onset of symptoms occur anywhere
between the ages of 3 to 7 years old. It is also 3 times more likely to
occur in males than in females. Tics vary from person to person and the
severity ranges from mild to severe. Tics also wax and wane. It is
hardly ever constant. Stress, anxiety, and even excitement can trigger
an increase in tics. Symptoms are usually most severe during puberty and
usually dies out in adulthood. It is rare to see it continue so severely
into adulthood like me but I am a rare creature. <br></p>
<p>I hope this information is informative for you. I generally like to
educate others on what it is but then I do not want to think about it
again. I am highly functional as a person with TS if I am not directly
thinking about the tics so if they are brought up more tics will come
out. You can of course ask questions about it but it is usually good to
just ignore the tics and slowly filter them out of your mind much like I
do and continue working. It helps to know that you know what it is.</p>
<div id="symptoms" class="section level1">
<h1>Symptoms: <br></h1>
<p><strong>Tics</strong> - involuntary, rapid or sudden movements or
vocalizations that occur repetitively <br></p>
<div id="types-of-tics" class="section level3">
<h3>Types of Tics: <br></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motor Tics</strong> - Involuntary movements such as eye
blinking, facial grimacing, and neck jerking <br></li>
<li><strong>Vocal Tics</strong> - Involuntary sounds or vocalizations
<br></li>
<li><strong>Tics of the Mind</strong> - Difficult to define and
distinguish from cognitive OCD. Just as a simple motor tic can occur
this occurs in the mind in some similar fashion <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="subtypes" class="section level3">
<h3>Subtypes: <br></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple Tics</strong> - usually sudden, fast, brief, and
meaningless movements that involve a specific muscle group <br>
<ul>
<li>Examples: eye blinking, facial grimacing, head and neck jerks,
throat clearing, spitting, and grunting <br></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Complex Tics</strong> - usually a cluster of movements that
appear coordinated. <br>
<ul>
<li>Examples: clapping, touching something or someone in some fashion,
hitting oneself, or complex facial expressions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div id="uncommon-or-rare-complex-tic-types" class="section level4">
<h4>Uncommon or Rare Complex Tic Types: <br></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Echopraxia</strong> - involuntary imitation or repetition of
some action seen or observed <br></li>
<li><strong>Echolalia</strong> - involuntary imitation or repetition of
something that is spoken or heard <br></li>
<li><strong>Palipraxia</strong> - involuntary repetitions of ones own
movements <br></li>
<li><strong>Palilalia</strong> - involuntary repetition of ones own
speech <br></li>
<li><strong>Copropraxia</strong> - involuntary performing obscene
gestures <br></li>
<li><strong>Coprolalia</strong> - involuntary vocalizations where one
blurts out obscenities* <br></li>
</ul>
<p>*I do not have any of these types of tics but they exist out there.
The media in particular likes to focus in on Coprolalia and make fun of
it and misdirect people into thinking this is what Tourette’s is when
less than 10% of TS patients have this symptom.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="comorbidities" class="section level3">
<h3>Comorbidities:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OCD</strong> - Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: a disorder in
which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations
(obsessions) that make them feel driven to do something repetitively
(compulsions) <br></li>
<li><strong>ADHD</strong> - Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: a
disorder where one cannot maintain focus on any one thing for long
<br></li>
<li><strong>MDD</strong> - Major Depressive Disorder: characterized by
persistently low mood or loss of interest in activities <br></li>
<li><strong>GAD</strong> - Generalized Anxiety Disorder: characterized
by persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things
<br></li>
</ul>
<p>There are likely others but these are at least the most common. I
personally have OCD in addition to TS. These comorbidities can feed into
each other making a truly horrible combination. For example obsessively
worrying about how other people are perceiving you and your tics and
bringing on a sense of doom if I do not do something feeds into the urge
to tic and more tics come about because I am anxious.</p>
</div>
<div id="diagnostic-criterion" class="section level3">
<h3>Diagnostic Criterion:</h3>
<ul>
<li>having at least one motor and one vocal tic occurring for at least
one year before the age of 18 with symptoms not explained by any other
medical condition</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="causes" class="section level1">
<h1>Causes</h1>
<ul>
<li>There is no known definite cause and there is no cure <br></li>
<li>misfiring neurons in a highly specialized and complex motor system
called the Basal Ganglia (BG) <br></li>
<li>There is a genetic factor or a highly hereditary disorder <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="neuropathophysiology" class="section level1">
<h1>Neuropathophysiology</h1>
<div id="cortico-basal-ganglia-thalmocortical-pathways-cbgt"
class="section level3">
<h3>Cortico-Basal Ganglia Thalmocortical Pathways (CBGT)</h3>
<p>These pathways are directions for brain signals from the cortex to go
into the BG and providing output back to the cortex <br> -
<strong>Direct</strong> - positive feedback loop that facilitates
movement <br> - <strong>Indirect</strong> - negative feedback loop that
inhibits movement <br> - <strong>Hyperdirect</strong> - also negative
feedback loop but bypasses an input structure in the brain. This too
inhibits movement <br></p>
<div id="important-anatomical-structures" class="section level4">
<h4>Important Anatomical Structures</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>STN</strong> - Sub-Thalamic Nucleus</li>
<li><strong>GPi</strong> - Globus Pallidus interior These areas of the
brain are significantly involved in the pathways of neural signals in
the BG</li>
</ul>
<p><img width="350" height="350" src="pathways.jpg">
<img width="350" height="350" src="bg.jpg"> <br></p>
<ul>
<li>The direct pathway activates desired movements and actions coming
from the cortex where we decide what we want to do</li>
<li>The other two pathways suppress any unwanted competing
movements</li>
<li>Therefore, selected movements are enabled and competing movements
are prevented from interfering with the one selected</li>
<li>However; anatomical evidence points out that these circuits are far
more complex than this</li>
<li>In the pathophysiology of TS structural changes in the BG have been
reported in a broad range of these cortical areas in the brain</li>
<li>Various neuroimaging studies have shown reduced volumes and abnormal
asymmetries of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus</li>
<li>Studies have also shown that in patients with TS there are abnormal
grey matter volumes (neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, glial cells, and
synapses) and other abnormalities in white matter (mylinated axons, how
action potentials are propagated)</li>
<li>Errors in the inhibition of unwanted competing movements can lead to
tics.</li>
<li>In TS, this unwanted inhibition of the main output nuclei of the BG
leads to disinhibition (an increase in strength of the stimulus of an
unrelated extinguished response) of its thalamocortical targets and thus
in turn can lead to repeated stereotyped unwanted movements like
tics</li>
<li>Mechanisms that can be responsible for such an unwanted activation
are:
<ul>
<li>excessive cortical or thalamic input to the striatum (primary input
to the BG)</li>
<li>deficiency of intrastriatal inhibition</li>
<li>abnormal dopamine transmission</li>
<li>abnormal membrane excitability</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Many features of TS can be explained as a failure to inhibit unwanted
movements, behaviors, and thoughts resulting from these abnormal BG
output patterns. For example, abnormal activation of the motor cortex
can produce simple tics, and abnormal activation of the premotor cortex
can lead to complex tics.</p>
<p>In summary input signals are coming from the cortex go to the
striatum to the basal ganglia taking either the direct or indirect
pathway filtering out some movement and outputs back to the motor cortex
where the body produces physical movement. When these signals misfire so
to speak tics are produced.</p>
</div>
<div id="dopaminergic-neurotransmitter-system" class="section level4">
<h4>Dopaminergic Neurotransmitter System</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dopaminergic Neurons</strong> - neurons that activate based
on dopamine <br></li>
<li>In the BG these neurons overall enhances the thalamacortical
excitation <br></li>
<li>Abnormalities in this system seems to play a significant role in
TS</li>
<li>Studies show these abnormalities in the striatum</li>
<li>This is why medications that are dopamine antagonists usually
supress tics
<ul>
<li><strong>antagonist</strong> is one that blocks the neurotransmitter
in the neuron</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Much more research is needed on the pathophysiology of this disorder.
Most current research is focused on the genetic factor that would lead
to these structural changes. With the rise of bioinformatics and
computational systems biology we could see further results</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="treatments" class="section level1">
<h1>Treatments</h1>
<ul>
<li>There is no medication specifically for TS</li>
<li>Medications are prescribed based on what might aid tic reduction in
the circuitry</li>
<li>Doctors go-to medications are neuroleptics or anti-psychotics, which
are dopamine antagonists
<ul>
<li>e.g. Haldol or Risperdal</li>
<li>Horrible side effects: Sedation, weight gain, dizziness, nausea,
fatigue, depression, and insomnia</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Doctors also resort to off label use of other medications:
Guanfacine or Clonodine; these are approved for the use in treating high
blood pressure but not TS</li>
<li>Other medications: Benzodiazpine’s like Xanax, Ativan or
Klonopin</li>
<li>SSRI’s or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors such as
fluoxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine. Targets serotonin systems over
dopamine</li>
<li>SNRI’s or Serotonin-Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as
Venlafaxine or Effexor. Targets norepinephrine (another
neurotransmitter) in addition to serotonin</li>
<li>Nicotine Patches</li>
<li>Cannabinoids like marijuana or cannabidiol (CBD)</li>
</ul>
<div id="behavioral-interventions" class="section level4">
<h4>Behavioral Interventions</h4>
<ul>
<li>CBT or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: working with a psychologist on
isolating a specific behavior or even a tic to change how you
cognitively, emotionally, and physically react or respond to it.</li>
<li>CBIT or Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics: more
specialized version of CBT, not many psychologists are trained in using
it, It involves giving a competing response to tics, which involves
becoming particularly aware of how and when you tic, and redirecting the
tic to a competing response behavior. e.g. I have a tic where I hit
myself in the face if I want to reduce that tic I would have a competing
response, any time I had the urge to slap my face I would instead
redirect the tension to move my arm outward. This is incredibly
difficult if not impossible in some cases because tics cannot be
controlled it is involuntary it just happens.But this training can be
useful in treating tics and helping your quality of life</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="deep-brain-stimulation-dbs-surgery" class="section level4">
<h4>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Surgery</h4>
<ul>
<li>Involves the implantation of a neurostimulator or leads into a
particular area of the brain in the BG</li>
<li>the neurostimulator or a lead has four contact points on it that
sends out charges or stimulation based on the parameters of stimulation
programmed by a neurologist</li>
<li>The settings of these parameters are housed in a battery pack that
is put typically in your chest and is connected to the brain
stimulators</li>
<li>Settings to be adjusted:
<ul>
<li>voltage current or amplitude: the amount of charge given, usually
very high charges are good for tics</li>
<li>pulse width: the length of time the charge is given</li>
<li>frequency: how often the charge is given</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are two modes a particular contact point on a lead can take:
<ul>
<li>Monopolar Stimulation: the contact point acts as an anode or a
positively charged area thus giving charge to the brain. More spherical
in shape</li>
<li>Bipolar Stimulation: One contact point acts as an anode and another
contact point as a cathode or taking charge away thus giving a
stimulation structure that at one level is giving charges and at another
is sucking up charge. More elliptical in shape</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>DBS is most popularly done in Parkinson’s Disease Patients but its
uses are being explored for other disorders.</p>
<div id="targets-for-dbs-in-patients-with-ts" class="section level5">
<h5>Targets for DBS in patients with TS</h5>
<ul>
<li>GPi - Globus Pallidus interior</li>
<li>STN - Sub-Thalamic Nucleus</li>
</ul>
<p>More generally the substructures of the BG are targeted. <br> - DBS
creates a functional ablation or lesion, which reduces information flow
through the stimulated nucleus <br> - In theory if the targeted location
is correct in DBS, the lesioning out the misfirings of TS may result in
a significant reduction in tics <br></p>
<p><img width = "450" height = "350" src="deepBrain.jpg"> <br></p>
<p>I personally have undergone DBS 5 times in the past 10 years. That is
4 too many or maybe 5. The reasons for this are complicated <br></p>
